                        Poverty has detrimental impacts. Children who grow up in poverty experience more severe, ongoing, and frequent health issues than kids who have better financial situations.
                        <br><br> Low birth weight is common in babies born into poverty, and it is linked to numerous avoidable mental and physical impairments. These poor babies are not only more likely to be cranky or ill, but they are also more likely to pass away before their first birthday.
                        <br><br>
                        Children who grow up in poverty frequently miss school due to illness. Additionally, these kids experience many more accidents than other kids do, and they are twice as likely to have vision and hearing impairments, anemia from iron insufficiency, and blood lead levels that are higher than usual, which can affect brain function.
                        <br><br>
                        Economic situations have been proven to be correlated with family stress levels. According to studies conducted during economic downturns, job loss and the ensuing poverty are linked to family violence, especially the elder and child abuse. Stress is substantially higher for poor families than for middle-class ones. These families are more likely to experience a string of unfavorable circumstances and "bad luck," such as illness, depression, eviction, job loss, victimization by the criminal justice system, and family deaths, in addition to financial difficulties. Parents who are going through a difficult time financially may become too strict and unstable, making demands backed by insults, threats, and physical punishment.
                        <br></br> People who are poor are more likely to reside in underprivileged areas and in crowded or inappropriate dwellings.
                        Low-income households frequently deny their children access to activities that most of us take for granted. They can't afford to take a one-week vacation away from home, they can't have friends around for tea, and they lose out on school trips.
                        <br><br>
                        Being poor involves more than just not having enough money or other resources to support a sustainable way of life. It shows up as starvation and malnutrition, restricted access to healthcare and other necessities, social isolation and prejudice, and a lack of involvement in decision-making.
