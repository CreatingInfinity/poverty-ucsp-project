                        In addition to a lack of funds, poverty also refers to the inability to enjoy leisure activities, take children on class field excursions or to birthday celebrations, or find the money to pay for prescription drugs. These are all costs associated with poverty. People who are already struggling to pay for necessities like food and shelter just cannot think about these additional charges. When people are excluded from society, are undereducated, or are more prone to illness, these factors have a detrimental impact on society. Everybody is impacted by poverty.
                        <br><br>There are numerous reasons for poverty, and neither a single cause nor an all-encompassing cure exists. In reality, the majority of the time, a number of variables combine to generate poverty. Understanding these components in depth and how they work together is the key to eradicating poverty.

                        1. Inequality <br><br>People who are denied certain rights or belongings due to their ethnicity or tribal affiliation have fewer opportunities to succeed in life. This is especially true when it comes to women's rights in terms of their health and financial situation and the gender pay gap. In this situation, equality isn't even a relative idea. It makes no difference who has more. What matters is that someone else lacks the necessary resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Conflict<br><br>
                        Let's talk about dangers because poverty is a result of risk exacerbated by inequality. The primary risk factor for poverty is conflict. Large-scale, protracted crises can entirely destroy an otherwise robust economy, as was the case with the 11-year Syrian civil war. For instance, while conflict continues in Syria, millions of people have fled their homes, frequently with nothing more than the clothing on their backs. Public buildings were demolished. Only 10% of Syrians were regarded as being impoverished prior to 2011. Currently, it is estimated that more than 80% of Syrians are living in poverty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Malnutrition, Stunting, and Hunger<br><br>
                    If you think that hunger is a result of poverty, you're probably right. However, hunger is another element that contributes to poverty. If a person doesn't eat enough, they won't have the strength and energy needed for employment. Alternatively, if they don't eat enough, their immune system will weaken, leaving them more susceptible to illness and preventing them from working.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        4. Poor healthcare systems — especially for mothers and children <br><br>

                        With the impacts of hunger, being in bad health, and having a very low standard of life go hand in hand. In countries with weak healthcare systems, diseases that are easily curable yet can be lethal include respiratory infections, malaria, and diarrhea. especially for small children.
                        <br><br>
                        Long-distance medical trips and the cost of prescription drugs drain the finances of already precarious households. A family may be pushed from extreme poverty into poverty as a result. Particularly for women, pregnancy and childbirth can be lethal. Maternal health is typically one of the healthcare sectors that is most neglected in civilizations that are still built on patriarchal traditions. Pregnant women and new moms are commonly forbidden from obtaining care without their husbands' or fathers' permission. Pregnant teenage girls face much greater discrimination and unfairness, particularly if it occurs outside of marriage.

                    <p>
                        5.	Little (or zero) access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene <br> <br>

                        More than 2 billion people do not have access to clean water at this time. This suggests that, collectively, individuals walk long distances to acquire water for 200 million hours every day. That is time that may be better utilized working or studying to increase the likelihood of obtaining employment in the future. And you were correct if you assumed that the majority of these 200 million hours were worked by women and girls. Women face water-related issues, which exacerbate poverty.
                        <br><br>
                        Contaminated water can also result in a number of waterborne illnesses, ranging in severity from chronic to life-threatening. Inadequate water infrastructure, such as lavatory and hygiene facilities, might make this worse. There may also be other barriers to leaving poverty, such as a rule prohibiting females from attending school when they are menstruation.

                    </p>
                    <p>6. Climate change <br><br>
                        Hunger, conflict, inequality, and a lack of education are just a few of the causes of poverty that are interconnected by climate change, which also contributes to extreme poverty (see below). According to one World Bank analysis, nearly 100 million people could fall into poverty over the following ten years as a result of the climate catastrophe.
                        <br><br>
                        Many of the world's poorest people depend on farming or hunting to provide for their families. For instance, agriculture accounts for 80% of the economy in Malawi. They frequently don't have enough food or resources to continue into the following season, and they don't have adequate reserves to fall back on in case of a bad harvest. Therefore, when climatic change or natural disasters leave millions of people without food, it can make recovery even more challenging.
                    </p>
                    <p>7. Lack of education <br><br>
                        Not all people without a formal education are in dire straits. However, the majority of individuals who lived in abject poverty did not acquire a good education. And if they have kids, they're probably passing that on to the next generation. Around the world, there are many obstacles to education, such as a lack of funding for uniforms and textbooks or cultural prejudice towards girls' education.
                        <br><br>
                        But the phrase "great equalizer" is commonly used to describe education. That's because it may open doors to employment as well as other opportunities and knowledge a family needs to not only survive but also thrive. According to UNESCO, 171 million people may be rescued from extreme poverty if they graduated from high school with rudimentary reading abilities. Education is threatened by poverty, yet education can also fight poverty.
                    </p>
                    <img class="img-1" src="image/319792335_455667279977081_5771015255927558881_n.jpg">
                    <p>
                        8. Poor public works and infrastructure <br> <br>
                            What if there are no roads to bring you where you need to go for work? What if your route has been inundated by recent strong rains and is impassable? Similar "roadblocks," as it were, are common in Ireland. However, we can typically count on our local governments to take action.
                            <br><br>
                            Rural villages may become isolated due to a lack of infrastructure, which includes things like roads, bridges, wells, cables for electricity, smartphones, and the internet. Living off the grid frequently entails being unable to travel to work, school, or the market to acquire and sell items. Accessing basic services requires longer travel times and additional expenses, which keeps families in poverty.
                            <br><br>
                            The last two years have shown us that isolation reduces opportunity. Without opportunities, many people find it difficult, if not impossible, to escape extreme poverty, which includes diseases and pandemics.
                            Speaking of lessons acquired over the past two years, one factor contributing to poverty is an inadequate healthcare system that has an impact on specific people or even entire communities. However, a pandemic or epidemic on a vast scale deserves to be included here. The COVID-19 outbreak is not the first time a public health emergency has accelerated the poverty cycle. Ebola in West Africa (and subsequently in the DRC), cholera in Haiti or the DRC, and malaria in Sierra Leone have all shown how local and national administrations can come to a complete standstill while attempting to end the epidemic.
                            <br><br>
                            All of this, of course, has a price. In Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the three nations hardest hit by the West African Ebola epidemic from 2014 to 2016, an estimated $2.2 billion in GDP losses were a direct result of the virus in 2015. Losses in the private sector, agricultural output, and international trade were included in this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        9. Lack of personal safety nets <br><br>
                        A family or community can withstand some hazards if they have reserves in place. Even if the government doesn't have support systems to protect them, they can fall back on savings accounts or even a low-interest loan in the event of a health concern or an unexpected layoff. If a drought or other natural calamity destroys the next harvest, proper food storage methods can help stretch a prior one.
                        <br><br>
                        Poverty is fundamentally a lack of essential assets or a lack of income from one's assets.
                        <br><br>
                        However, these safety nets are useless for those who are really poor. Poverty is fundamentally a lack of essential assets or a lack of income from one's assets. This causes people to use unhealthy coping techniques, such as removing kids from school to work (or even getting married) and selling off assets to pay for food. That can assist a family in getting through one difficult time but not another. The repeated shocks can plunge a family into extreme poverty and prevent them from ever recovering in places that are subject to ongoing climate extremes or protracted conflict.

                    <header>
                        <p>                        First is the increase in farm wages and the rising number of Filipinos getting incomes outside agriculture. This accounts for two-thirds of the decline in poverty.
                        </p>

                    <main>
                        <p> The second reason for the poverty reduction are transfers from social programs, contributing 25% in the reduction of poverty. Foremost of these transfers is the Government’s Pantawid Pamilya, the government’s primary social assistance program. Expanded in the last few years, Pantawid extends cash grants to 77% of poor households and contributes to reducing poverty and to building of human capital — meaning that the children of poor families remain in school and stay healthy. This trend is consistent with the global experience with the impact of social safety nets on poverty.

                        <p>
                            The third reason: remittances from both domestic and foreign sources contribute about 12% and 6% of poverty reduction. Two-thirds of Filipinos, or 15 million households, receive domestic and foreign remittances.
                        School enrollment has notably increased in recent years, with universal and mandatory kindergarten as well as two years of senior high school added to the education cycles. Pro-poor policies and changes to health insurance coverage have resulted in increased use of health services. Access to clean water and sanitation and electricity has improved. Social safety nets were expanded to cover most of the poor
                        <br><br>
                        Despite these gains, however, there are still around 22 million Filipinos living below the poverty line as of 2015.
                        Compared to its neighbours in the Southeast Asian region, the country isn’t reducing poverty fast enough. While Vietnam, Indonesia, and China have been reducing poverty at 2.1 to 2.4 percentage points per year measured by the international poverty line, the Philippines’ rate of poverty reduction has been less than 1 percentage point each year in the past decade.
